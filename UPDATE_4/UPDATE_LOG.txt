I wasn't mentally feeling well yesterday (10/28/2021) I didn't write in the Github or work on code and Monkar wasn't at the robotics meeting so we didn't work on code.But the rest of the team pulled through and I think next meeting we will be ready to attach the claw and the vertical slide for the claw to go up and down it's going to be epic. If I have time I will include pictures of the robot and the claw and the vertical slide.

Let me explain how the vertical slide going to work so our motor is going to rotate with a gear attached and push a gear track up and down making the metal piece with the claw go up and down. So we can reach higher places and reach lower places.
